# Ghost-Anti-Process
An application designed to kill unnecessary background applications to allow more CPU time for CPU intensive workloads such as gaming or rendering.

In the source file GhostAntiProcess.vb, you will find the loop which contains all the processes that this application targets. You can add or remove processes by simply creating a new IF statement or removing an existing IF statement.

Furthermore, if you'd like to add a toggle checkbox, add a new checkbox to the primary form, and then add an IF check for that process, and again, see the GhostAntiProcess.vb file for an example.
